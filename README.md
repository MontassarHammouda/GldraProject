# GldraProject
# Docker configuration

After you install [Docker][4] and [Docker Compose][5], create a new folder named `GLDRA`, copy the [archive](../files/archives/jobeet.zip) into the folder and decompress it.
It is initial configuration for generic PHP project, which was generated by service [phpdocker.io][9].
It includes PHP 7.2, MySQL 5.7 and nginx. To start containers just run next command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

What we did here:

* we called `docker-compose` that wraps the functionality of Docker and does working with Docker easier
* this command reads configuration from `docker-compose.yml` from folder where command is run
* `up` means start and run our entire application
* `-d` means detached mode. Command will run containers in the background and console will be free to use for next commands.

After several minutes containers will be running and you can check it with next command:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

The result should be the same:

```bash
      Name                   Command             State           Ports          
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GLDRA-mysql       docker-entrypoint.sh mysqld   Up      0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp 
GLDRA-php-fpm     /bin/sh -c /usr/bin/php-fpm   Up      9000/tcp               
GLDRA-webserver   nginx -g daemon off;          Up      0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
Congratulations! Now you have prepared environment for Jobeet project.

## Download and install Symfony 4.2

To create our Symfony project we will use method described in official [documentation][6].
First of all, enter PHP container:

```bash
docker-compose exec php-fpm bash
```

* `exec` command is used to run commands in container
* `php-fpm` is the name of the container (line 27 in `docker-compose.yml` file)
* `bash` executes bash in the container

Now you are in php container. Run `php -v` to check that php exists and the version is `7.2.x`.

After that create Symfony project in `tmp` _(temporary)_ folder, copy it to your project folder, exit from container and change permission of files to be able to edit them from your IDE:

```bash
composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton:4.2.* /tmp/GLDRA/
cp -aR /tmp/GLDRA/. .
exit;
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
```

We install into `tmp` directory and copy then to proper one, because `create-project` command requires target folder to be empty, but in project’s folder we already have docker files.

## Test the Symfony installation

Now open your web browser and enter the [http://127.0.0.1][7] URL. You should see error `No route found for "GET /"` but it’s OK. You don’t have any routes created yet.
